# Contributing

We highly encourage contributions from all Stache users. Stache components extend SKY UX capabilities for documentation, so we just ask that you follow the SKY UX 2 coding conventions in the existing code and that you write the appropriate documentation and unit tests for your feature.

For information about working with SKY UX, see the [SKY UX documentation](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/). And for more information about how to contribute, see the [SKY UX contribution guidelines](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/contribute).
